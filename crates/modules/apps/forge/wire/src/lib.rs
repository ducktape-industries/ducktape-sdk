//! the forge module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! forge is a git-backed module: its state is a NAMED NAMESPACE of git repos,
//! addressed by a repo slug (`[a-z0-9._-]`, 1..=64 bytes). its `root()` is a
//! canonical sorted hash over the committed HEAD oid of every repo that has a
//! head. git writes go via [`ForgeMsg::PushRefs`]; reads via [`ForgeQuery`] ->
//! [`ForgeReply`], returning HEAD oids as hex.
//!
//! ## the default repo
//!
//! the `repo` field is REQUIRED on every [`ForgeMsg`] variant, but an empty
//! slug is a first-class value: the module normalizes `repo == ""` to the
//! well-known `"default"` repo. a single-repo client sends `repo: ""` and
//! queries `"head"` to keep targeting one canonical repo; the multi-repo
//! surface ([`ForgeQuery::HeadOf`]/[`ForgeQuery::ListRepos`]) is purely
//! additive.
