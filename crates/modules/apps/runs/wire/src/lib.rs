//! The runs module's wire surface: the messages and queries the module answers,
//! the records it stores, the action catalog a program's operations decode to,
//! and the programs the module runs. Types and their codecs, no module — so a
//! view or the daemon links THIS and not the 20,000-line module behind it.
//!
//! It names `sdk` (origins, ids) and `agent-wire` (a program IS an agent
//! program), because its types are made of theirs. Both are SDK-shaped: no
//! `native` feature, no kernel host, no disk.
