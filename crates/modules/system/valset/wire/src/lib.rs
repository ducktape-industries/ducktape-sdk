//! the valset module's public wire surface — types only.
//!
//! valset is the ed25519 membership registry as replicated state: VALIDATORS
//! (the consensus quorum) via [`ValsetMsg::Join`] / [`ValsetMsg::Leave`], and
//! RESIDENTS (mesh + statesync standing, NO consensus participation) via
//! [`ValsetMsg::Grant`] / [`ValsetMsg::Revoke`] — the staged-admission tier a
//! joiner syncs in before promotion. reads go via [`ValsetQuery`] ->
//! [`ValsetReply`]. each `key` is a 32-byte ed25519 public key encoding (the
//! impl crate validates the curve point; this crate stays types-only), plus
//! the two shared READS every membership-gated module funnels through
//! ([`members`], [`members_and_residents`]): a query over the host-routed
//! read lane, no state of its own.
