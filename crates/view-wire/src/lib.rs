//! The wire between a host and a view running in wasm.
//!
//! The guest ships a WIDGET TREE, not a picture: every tick it returns the
//! [`Node`] its view built, with every value inlined — text, colours, sizes —
//! and the host's own toolkit does layout, render, fonts, IME, clipboard and
//! scroll. The guest never learns where anything landed, which is the point:
//! there is nothing in it to draw with.
//!
//! Interaction goes back as MEANING, not input. A button carries the index of
//! the message the guest queued for it this frame ([`Node::Button`]'s
//! `on_press`); the host sends [`Event::Message`] with that index and the
//! guest runs its own handler. A text field carries a handler index; the host
//! owns the text and sends [`Event::Input`] with what it now reads; a
//! multiline editor the same, with [`Event::EditorTransaction`]. A
//! checkbox, slider or pick list likewise carries a handler index and the
//! host sends the new value ([`Event::Toggle`], [`Event::Slide`],
//! [`Event::Select`]).
//!
//! The types here are the one definition of the format: the guest serializes
//! them and the host deserializes the same code, so a field neither side can
//! drop silently. A host that reads a frame from an untrusted module runs
//! [`sanitize`] first.

/// Exact bincode protocol implemented by this build. Bump on serialized shape changes,
/// in the SAME commit as the shape change: a view built against the old shape is
/// refused at load instead of faulting on its first frame.
/// This is independent of WIT signatures and the manifest text format.
///
/// 8: `Event::Response` carries `Result<Vec<u8>, Refusal>` (1b4d8a0 changed the
///    shape and left the epoch at 7; views deployed before it faulted with
///    "invalid u8 while decoding bool" on the first refusal frame).
/// 9: accessible names and roles: `label` on `Node::Editor`, `Slider`, `ComboBox`
///    and `PickList`; `role`, `label`, `expanded`, `selected` and `checked` on
///    `Node::MouseArea`; `selected` on `Node::Button`.
/// 10: the rest of the accessible shape: `heading` and `live` on `Node::Text`,
///    `label` on `Node::Overlay`, `role` on `Node::Button`.
